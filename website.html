       <p>The dog is a mammal with sharp teeth, an excellent sense of smell,<br> and a fine sense of hearing. Each of its four legs ends in a foot,<br> or paw, with five toes. Each toe has a soft pad and a claw.<br> A coat of hair keeps the dog warm.</p>

       <p>Cats have sharp, retractable (except in the cheetah) <br>claws, and their teeth are adapted for stabbing, anchoring, and cutting. <br>They almost always land on their feet when they fall from a height. <br>Most species are nocturnal, and their eyes are adapted for seeing in low light.</p>
